Lionel Messi, widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time, began his career at FC Barcelona’s youth academy (La Masia) at just 13 years old. After overcoming a growth hormone deficiency, Messi made his **first-team debut in 2004**, at 17. Over the next 17 years, he became Barcelona’s all-time top scorer and the centerpiece of one of the greatest football teams in history. His dazzling dribbling, vision, and goal-scoring abilities led Barcelona to **numerous La Liga titles, Champions League victories**, and domestic cups. Messi won **Ballon d'Or** awards a record **seven times** (as of 2021).
In 2021, after financial struggles at Barcelona, Messi joined Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) on a free transfer, marking the end of his era at Barcelona. At PSG, he continued to excel, adding more trophies to his collection.
On the international stage, Messi initially struggled with Argentina, but in 2021, he led them to Copa América glory, his first major international title. In **2022**, Messi reached the pinnacle by leading **Argentina to victory in the World Cup**, solidifying his legacy as one of the all-time greats.
